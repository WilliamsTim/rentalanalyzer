## Home page
The home page is the first thing that you see. It has you input the necessary information in a form and has validation insuring that the necessary fields are filled out. It also has optional form fields after the requiste fields have been filled out. This will allow greater accuracy in the calculation.

## Analysis page
The analysis page is where you are taken once the forms on the front page are submitted. It takes the information from the other page and contacts the backend serverless function using that information. It then formats the ten year, fifteen year, and thirty year mortgages, showing the payments that would be made, alogn with the whether or not they would be profitable based upon the input expected rent.
